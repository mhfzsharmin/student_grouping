This repo has been created to assign students into a set of groups. To create the groups, I used a genetic algorithm, Tabu Search, which takes the survey results from students of their self-declared skills (social and knowledge) and apply the maximally diverse grouping method as described in this article: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5518761/

The ‘workflow.rmd’ file describes how you will run for your own input files.
